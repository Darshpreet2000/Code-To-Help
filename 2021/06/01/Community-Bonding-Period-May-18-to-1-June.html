<p>Hello Everyone,</p>

<p>I am very happy to start my Google Summer of Code journey with LibreHealth, I will be working on Mobile App Development Project, I am very much Thankful to LibreHealth &amp; Google for selecting me again. I have also successfully completed GSoC previous year &amp; have worked on <a href="https://gitlab.com/librehealth/toolkit/cost-of-care">Cost of Care</a> project of LibreHealth.</p>

<h2 id="about-project">About Project</h2>

<p>To develop an Android &amp; IOS application to provide clinical decision-support for nurses and doctors delivering essential newborn care interventions during the first day of life. This application provides knowledge, skills, and competencies to nurses and doctors in low/middle-income settings so that they can provide life-saving care to newborns from birth through 24 hours postnatal. App uses DHIS2 as backend &amp; can be setup for any hospital/organization</p>

<p>The Goals of this project are</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to track multiple babies at a time;</li>
  <li>Time-stamping births to generate an essential newborn care clock for each baby being tracked in the app;</li>
  <li>Automated classification of babies health status, based on results from observations and assessments that are conducted during the first 2 hours after birth;</li>
  <li>Automated advice on management of babies, based on their classification; Reminders/alerts to provide recommended essential newborn care interventions;</li>
  <li>If particular interventions are not delivered on time, or at all, capture of information regarding why this essential newborn care was late, or missed</li>
</ul>
