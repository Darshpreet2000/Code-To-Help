<h2 id="Coding-Period-Started">Coding Period Started<a class="anchor-link" href="#Coding-Period-Started"> </a></h2><p>With the beginning of this month, GSoC Coding Period begins, I started working actively, I also had Video call with my mentor last week &amp; we discussed a lot about this project &amp; program. My mentors suggested me to first work on frontend of App ( Developing UI Screens ) with dummy data &amp; later work on backend.</p>
<h2 id="Developing-UI-Screens-of-App-with-Dummy-Data">Developing UI Screens of App with Dummy Data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Developing-UI-Screens-of-App-with-Dummy-Data"> </a></h2><p>This week I made UI screens of App with Dummy Data, I added Navigation Drawer, Bottom Navigation in app. I made UI of each screen. Some screens UI are pending but, I will do it by next week.</p>
<p>I will discuss here each screen I made with Dummy Data for now</p>
<h3 id="1.-Home-Screen">1. Home Screen<a class="anchor-link" href="#1.-Home-Screen"> </a></h3><p>This screen will display nearby hospitals with images, It contains a search bar with settings icon which displays settings to change radius to display nearby hospitals.</p>
<p>I have tried to make search bar similar to Google Play Store Search Bar.</p>

<h3 id="2.-Search-Screen">2. Search Screen<a class="anchor-link" href="#2.-Search-Screen"> </a></h3><p>It contains a search bar by which user can search for any procedure, It displays list of procedures</p>
<h3 id="3.-Settings-Screen">3. Settings Screen<a class="anchor-link" href="#3.-Settings-Screen"> </a></h3><p>It displays a slider which can control radius of UI.</p>
<h3 id="4.-Saved-Screens">4. Saved Screens<a class="anchor-link" href="#4.-Saved-Screens"> </a></h3><p>It will display list of chargemasters which are saved in local storage as SQL Database of App</p>
<h3 id="5.-View-CDM-Statewise">5. View CDM Statewise<a class="anchor-link" href="#5.-View-CDM-Statewise"> </a></h3><p>User can view CDM of any hospital of any state</p>

<ul>
<li>View CDM Statewise</li>
<li>Compare Hospitals </li>
<li>Share App</li>
<li>About App</li>
<li>Report a Bug</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom Navigation holds these UI</p>
