<h2 id="Showing-Progress-Indicator-while-downloading-CDM">Showing Progress Indicator while downloading CDM<a class="anchor-link" href="#Showing-Progress-Indicator-while-downloading-CDM"> </a></h2><p>The progress indicator shows percent 0-60 for downloading CDM, Rest of 60-100 percent are used for inserting downloaded large CSV to 
SQL Database in App</p>
<p>This task was really challenging for me, it involves a lot of state change &amp; also I first have to get original file size using GitLab API.</p>
<p>I have used BLoC Architecture properly for handling states of progress indicator.</p>
<p>Color of progress indicator change from red-orange-green.</p>

<h2 id="Working-on-Gitlab-CI-Pipeline">Working on Gitlab CI Pipeline<a class="anchor-link" href="#Working-on-Gitlab-CI-Pipeline"> </a></h2><p>I was able to successfully install chromedriver &amp; chromebrowser on Linux CI, but it was not working earlier because there was no display in CI terminal for bowser to display, I was getting an excaption, After searching a lot on StackOverFlow , I found a solution to use pyvirtualdisplay &amp; now it is working correctly.</p>
<p>The CI Pipeline Scraps CDM &amp; make a "Data" directory which contains CDM &amp; after running "process.py" it makes "CDM" directory which contains CDM in proper columns.</p>
<h2 id="Making-Process-Scripts-for-California-Hospitals">Making Process Scripts for California Hospitals<a class="anchor-link" href="#Making-Process-Scripts-for-California-Hospitals"> </a></h2><p>There are around 370 hospitals in california, Till now I have completed process script of around 250 Hospitals, for rest work I will surely complete by tomorrow.</p>
<p>This task is very time consuming &amp; also boring, I have to check column names, rows to skip in each CDM.</p>
<p>I will create its MR by tomorrow.</p>

So, this will done by tomorrow.</p>
