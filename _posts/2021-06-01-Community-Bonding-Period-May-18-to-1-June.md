## Community Bonding Period May 18 to 1 June


Hello Everyone, 

I am very happy to start my Google Summer of Code journey with LibreHealth, I will be working on Mobile App Development Project, I am very much Thankful to LibreHealth & Google for selecting me again. I have also successfully completed GSoC previous year & have worked on [Cost of Care](https://gitlab.com/librehealth/toolkit/cost-of-care) project of LibreHealth. 

## About Project

To develop an Android & IOS application to provide clinical decision-support for nurses and doctors delivering essential newborn care interventions during the first day of life. This application provides knowledge, skills, and competencies to nurses and doctors in low/middle-income settings so that they can provide life-saving care to newborns from birth through 24 hours postnatal. App uses DHIS2 as backend & can be setup for any hospital/organization

The Goals of this project are

- Ability to track multiple babies at a time;
- Time-stamping births to generate an essential newborn care clock for each baby being tracked in the app;
- Automated classification of babies health status, based on results from observations and assessments that are conducted during the first 2 hours after birth;
- Automated advice on management of babies, based on their classification; Reminders/alerts to provide recommended essential newborn care interventions;
- If particular interventions are not delivered on time, or at all, capture of information regarding why this essential newborn care was late, or missed

- Community Bonding Period in which you get to know your community and get familiar with their code base and work style.

- Ask for resources, required by you, to gain your knowledge for the parts of your project you donâ€™t know.

- Discuss and plan your GSoC work with your mentor.

- Discuss and plan your time-table for your summer.

## My Progress

- During the community bonding I have introduced myself to mentors & mentors are very much welcoming.
- I recieved access to DHIS2 for the application development, I have discussed with them about creating Programs, Stages, Attributes in DHIS2.  
- I read the documentation of DHIS2 Tracker API, Creating Program/Stages.
- I have created a program for On-Call-Doctors & I have to discuss it with mentors.
- I resolved my doubts related to modifying the already created program in DHIS2.

## Tasks For Next Week

- Completely setting up DHIS2 with all Programs/Stages/Attributes
- Finalising weekly tasks & creating milestones
- Reading Documentation 
- Discussing & showing mentors the programs I will modify in DHIS2
