<h2><strong>&nbsp;Project Idea</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 22px;">To make an app from scratch which can display costs of medical procedures of US hospitals. This app will display nearby hospitals and the user can filter the prices accordingly. App will download nearby hospitals CDM from Github Repository and save it to local storage of phone in SQL database. This App can work offline and will update data daily.</span></p>
