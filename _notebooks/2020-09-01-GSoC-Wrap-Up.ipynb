    "### Little Bit About Myself\n",
    "\n",
    "I am Darshpreet Singh currently pursuing Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering, I have just completed my second year of engineering. From the beginning of my second year I started learning mobile app development, I was really passionate about app development and then got into the field deeper with time, completed 2 internships, and so on my journey with open source started\n",

    "### Aiming for GSoC 2020 & Submitting POC, Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "I heard a lot about GSoC from my college seniors and LinkedIn, I started asking a lot to people on LinkedIn how to get selected & what more should I learn. I got replies from lot of people they guided me a lot. I aimed to get selected in GSoC in 2020, I contributed in some organisation before the GSoC but the projects I contributed to were not selected, I was little disappointed. Still I had some hope I kept searching in the organisation & projects list to find an android related project. Finally after searching a lot I found LibreHealth, they had a lot of projects in mobile development, I aimed to submit my best to this organisation, I completed the POC(Proof Of Concept) task in just 2 days, I also did more than the required. I communicated a lot with mentors & after discussing a lot I submitted my proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Selected \n",
    "\n",
    "It was a long month for me waiting for the results, On day of result I frequently checked my mail & GSoC website for result. It was 4th May at 11:30 PM, I got surprised to see that I am selected for GSoC, I was very happy, I thanked my mentors a lot for selecting me & assured them that I will defintely work hard & will make them feel proud of my work. Due to my excitement I was not able to sleep on time, I slept late at night but woke up early to start my GSoC journey & to tell my parents & friends about it. \n",

    "\n",
    "To make an app which can display costs of medical procedures of US hospitals & a web scraper which can scrape ChargeMasters & update data periodically in GitLab Repository.

App can download nearby hospitals ChargeMaster from GitLab Repository and save it to local storage of phone in SQL database. User can view downloaded ChargeMaster, search in it, filter by price & category. This App can work offline and can update downloaded ChargeMasters.\n",
